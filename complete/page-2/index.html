                <span class="fw-bold">Unrealized and Realized Gains</span> are two types of investment
                returns. Unrealized gains refer to the increase in the value of an investment that has not yet been
                sold. This means that while the investment has increased in value on paper, you have not actually earned
                a profit until you sell the investment. On the other hand, realized gains refer to the actual profit you
                make when you sell an investment that has increased in value. It's important to keep in mind that
                realized gains are subject to taxes, while unrealized gains are not.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-text">
                <span class="fw-bold">Dividends Received</span> refer to the payments made by a company to its
                shareholders from its profits. If you own shares in a company that pays dividends, you will receive a
                portion of the company's earnings in the form of regular payments. These payments can be made in cash or
                additional shares of stock, and they represent a return on your investment in the company. Dividends
                received can be reinvested into the company or used for personal expenses. It's important to note that
                not all companies pay dividends, and the amount and frequency of dividend payments can vary depending on
                the company's financial performance and policies.

                <span class="fw-bold">Funds Deposited</span> and <span class="fw-bold">Funds Withdrawn</span> refer to
                the movement of money in and out of a financial account. When you deposit funds into an account, you are
                adding money to it. For example, if you deposit $100 into a brokerage account, your funds deposited
                would be $100. On the other hand, when you withdraw funds from an account, you are taking money out of
                it. For example, if you transfer $100 from a brokerage account to your bank account, your funds
                withdrawn would be $100.
